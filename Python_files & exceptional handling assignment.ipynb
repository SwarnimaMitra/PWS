    "### Q: What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
    "A: Interpreted languages run code line-by-line using an interpreter (e.g., Python), while compiled languages translate the whole code into machine code before execution using a compiler (e.g., C, C++). Interpreted languages are easier to debug but slower, whereas compiled ones are faster but take time to compile.\n",

    "### Q: What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "A: Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to catch and handle runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks, ensuring the program doesn't crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "A: The finally block contains code that always executes after try and except blocks, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's commonly used for cleanup tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: What is logging in Python?\n",
    "A: Logging in Python is the process of recording events or messages that happen when software runs. It helps in debugging and monitoring applications using the logging module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "A: The __del__ method is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed. It's used to clean up resources before the object is deleted.\n",
